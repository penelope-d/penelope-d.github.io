          <ol>
          <li style="color:#FF0083;"> She lets you pet her belly</li>
          <li style="color:#E40808;">It is a very soft and plump belly</li>
          <li style="color:#FF2700;">She snuggles up on your lap wherever you are sitting</li>
          <li style="color:#FFE10D;">When she plays with her toys she does that kicky thing with her back legs</li>
          <li style="color:#1FD302;">She runs to the door and rolls around on the doormat whenever you return home</li>
          <li style="color:#04C79C;">Her favorite thing in the world is to sit in one of her many cardboard boxes that she barely fits into </li>
          <li style="color:#061ED2;">She never scratches you</li>
          <li style="color:#631FFC;"> Whenever you are home she will follow you around wherever you go </li>
          <li style="color:#9A06ED;"> Her head is empty of everything except for LOVE</li>
