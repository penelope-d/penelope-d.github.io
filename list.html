          <ol>
          <li> She lets you pet her belly</li>
          <li>It is a very soft and plump belly</li>
          <li>She snuggles up on your lap wherever you are sitting</li>
          <li>When she plays with her toys she does that kicky thing with her back legs</li>
          <li>She runs to the door and rolls around on the doormat whenever you return home</li>
          <li>Her favorite thing in the world is to sit in one of her many cardboard boxes that she barely fits into </li>
          <li>She never scratches you</li>
          <li> Whenever you are home she will follow you around wherever you go </li>
          <li> Her head is empty of everything except for LOVE</li>
    </ol>
